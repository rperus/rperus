### Driven by the limitless possibilities of data science and excited about the potential of blockchain and AI to revolutionize the financial landscape.

As an experienced business analyst with over 15 years of experience expanding technology companies across Latin America, I've honed my skills in identifying growth opportunities and driving success. I'm currently pursuing an MSc in Financial Technology at the University of Exeter and completed a MicroMasters in Data Science at MIT, fueling my passion for the intersection of finance and technology. Throughout my career, I've leveraged my expertise to drive meaningful growth and expansion, and I'm eager to continue doing so in exciting new ventures.
